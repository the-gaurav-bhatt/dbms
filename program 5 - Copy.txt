-- 5. Consider a relational database schema for a Sailors database below 
-- Sailors (sid: integer, sname: string, rating: integer, age: real); 
-- Boats (bid: integer, bname: string, color: string); 
-- Reserves (sid: integer, bid: integer, day: date). 
-- For the above schema, perform the following. 
-- a) Create the above tables by specifying primary keys and foreign keys. 
-- b) Insert around 10 records in each of the tables. 
-- c) Find the names of sailors who have reserved a red boat, and list in the order of age. 
-- d) Find the names of sailors who have reserved boat 103 
-- e) Find the name and the age of the youngest sailor. 
-- f) Find the average age of sailors for each rating level that has at least two sailors.
